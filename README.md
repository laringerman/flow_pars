# flow_pars

This is a python code for parsing products from a [website](https://flowwow.com/) by a specific delivery address and three requests.
The hidden API of the website itself is used to collect data.
The results are uploaded to [GoogleSheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19EuJn_2EUX0nS28yREoLFdxM9iilMBbns_6cnn5Iz_Q/edit?usp=sharing).
Using github actions, this script runs daily at 10am Moscow time.
